# License Plate Recognition System

## Introduction

This project is a system capable of automatically recognizing and extracting information from vehicle license plates in images or videos. The system utilizes image processing and deep learning techniques to achieve high accuracy under various environmental conditions.

## Technologies Used

-   **Programming Language:** Python
-   **Image Processing Library:** OpenCV
-   **Deep Learning Library:** TensorFlow / Keras
-   **Algorithms:** YOLOv8, CNN

## Installation and Usage

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/buitheanh874/DeepLearning
    cd license-plate-recognition
    ```

2.  **Install the required libraries:**
